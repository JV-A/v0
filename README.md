This repository is an initiative by Indian University students and Faculty, to facilitate learning and guidance for Data Scientists and Practitioners. \
The breadth of topics in the Data Science field is vast, and one can easily get overwhelmed with what to learn and where to learn it from. The intent of this project is to solve that very problem, by providing a one-stop destination for all the Data Science related topics. Irrespective of seniority, stage of learning or application, this repository provides resources to help facilitate self-learning in a short and concise manner. Additionally, it also details personal accounts from a diverse group of individuals of what their learning journeys have been like, and what is like to foray into a particular domain area.\
This initiative was started during Fall 2020 for the 'Data Science in Practice' course at Indiana University students under the guidance of Prof. David Wild and Project Mentor Kyle Stirling.

The contributions have been divided into 4 types - 

* **Data Science Learning Journeys**- These are personal accounts of a diverse group of people describing their learning journeys in this subject, the topics and tools they have covered and how they about learning them.
* **Data Science Knowledge Objects** - These are resources to get started in particular topic, programming language, libraries, packages etc and lists resources to learn them.
* **Data Science Domain Objects** - These are domain focused learning guides for Data Science application areas - whether you want to make a career in healthcare, finance or become a career Data Scientist.
* **Data Science Project Objects** - These are hands-on tutorials with codes as well as writen matter, where a subject is approached in the form of a project or case study.
