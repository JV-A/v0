This repository is an initiative by Indian University students and Faculty, to facilitate learning and guidance for Data Scientists and Practitioners. \
Irrespective of seniority, stage of learning or application, this repository provides resources to help facilitate self-learning in a short and concise manner. The breadth of topics in this field is vast, and one can easily get overwhelmed with what to learn and where to learn it from. The intent of this repo is to solve that very problem, by providing a one-stop destination for all the Data Science related topics. Additionally, this repository also details personal accounts of a diverse group of individuals in what their learning journeys have been like, and hwat is like to foray into a particular domain area.\
This initiative was started during Fall 2020 for the 'Data Science in Practice' course at Indiana University students under the guidance   
of Prof. David Wild and Project Mentor Kyle Stirling.


The repository consists of

* Data Science Learning Journeys
* Data Science Knowledge Objects
* Data Science Domain Objects
* Data Science Project Examples
