## Stage 1 : Predictive Analytics, Numpy and Pandas (2016-17)

I started my Data Science journey late in the Fall of 2016, and Kaggle&#39;s Titanic dataset was my starting point. Learning about types of variables, simple Excel manipulation and Data wrangling. I was fortunate to start directly with Python, and this part of learning mostly involved learning basics of Python, array manipulation with numpy and data manipulation with pandas. On a theoretical level, I covered everything from basics of Logistic Regression, EDA, Tree based models through the course of 2017. The programming fundamentals and Python was covered mostly from blogs and bunch of googling. I did not pursue a singular course material. I also referred to a lot of documentation to learn syntax and examples. However, to learn what kind of operations I needed, I mostly referred to solution notebooks on kaggle and blogs.
 What I lacked in this stage of learning was a &#39;big picture&#39; way of thinking, that is, improving that accuracy of you model is not the problem, it is only part of it, and turning a predictive model into a real world solution is a much needed skill.

Materials utilized : Numpy, pandas and SkLearn documentation, assorted blogs, Kaggle notebooks, Machine Learning by Andrew NG

## Stage 2 : Scikit learn, advanced EDA and Keras(2017-2018)

While I refined my skills in modelling and keeping up to date with state of art, I covered more libraries and concepts such as PCA, LDA and TSNE for EDA. I also covered methods to improve performance and provide prediction on a competitive level. I was selected for a full time position through one such hackathon which involved classification of highly imbalanced data. This included hyper-parameter tuning, models such as XGBOOST and Catboost. Again, I referred to blogs and library documentation to learn more. At the end of 2018, I also started Andrew NG&#39;s Deep Learning specialization to learn about theoretical concepts - Neural Networks, CNN, RNN and GANs. I implemented simple neural networks in Keras library and followed a long arduous method to utilize the 2GB GPU for deep learning.

Materials Used : Sklearn documentation, assorted blogs, Keras documentation, Deeplearning.AI material, INFO 231 for theoretical understanding

## Stage 3 : Professional Data Science, Big Data and healthcare consulting. (2018-19)

As I started working as a Data Scientist, I also learned R since it was the most used language among my peers and I had no choice. I spent a total of 3 days on R, going over data.table and H2O documentation. I also learned some basic SQL by looking at some production level code and some googling. Unlike Stage 1, I only needed to learn the syntax since conceptual basics of EDA were already clear.

While pursuing some Sentiment analysis project in my free time , I realized keras was a simplistic tool - easy for doing textbook implementation, but not suited for advanced customization and had a really unrefined documentation. I switched over to Pytorch and was able to cover a lot just by doing the Pytorch 60 minute blitz.

I also started my masters during Fall of 2019.

Materials Used : R and Pytorch documentation, assorted blogs, hands on exercises.

## Stage 4 : Switching over to prioritize Deep Learning, production level coding and getting the TA perspective (2019 -current)

After a few Deep Learning projects, I decided to pursue Deep Learning projects earnestly. Due to my earlier learning, I felt confident learning from research papers and github repositories directly, and understanding nuances of practical applications.

My learning currently has been through research papers, and ofcourse the constant reference to documentation and assorted blogs. I also spent considerable time working in visualization for a part-time job. I also covered aspects of practical NLP through some more research papers.

I also worked as a teaching assistant in summer 2020 for INFO 590 : Deep Learning for Bioinformatics. It gave a fresh perspective to prepare assignments and lecture notes for beginners in Deep Learning and making the materials so as to grasp without any prerequisites.

I am also learning the importance of Professional Writing, writing documentation, communication in a Professional setting as well as running meetings.

Materials Used : Pytorch documentation, assorted github and research papers.
