In this project, we undertake various Deep Learning datasets and problems, and uncover various hurdles that might not be seen in pretty Blogs and tutorials, but are often encountered in a practical scenario. \
We will attempt to solve these issues, as well as explore ways to improve performance, build visualizations and interpret the models. \
More modules with different set of challenges and solutions will be added regularly. \
While the individual modules are present in Jupyter notebook form, they can also be accessed with a link to a Google Colab notebook, which is recommended, because you can directly test out the code and utilize Google Colab's free GPU service.

#### Setup :
To install the libraries and pre-requisites, run "pip install -r requirements.txt". If Using Google Colab, most of the libraries are pre-installed and a code block to install additional ones is already present in the notebook.
