In this project, we undertake various Deep Learning datasets and problems, and uncover various hurdles that might not be seen in pretty Blogs and tutorials, but are often encountered in a practical scenario. We will attempt to solve these issues, as explore ways to improve performance, build visualizations and interpret the models.
More modules with different set of challenges and solutions will be added regularly.
While the individual modules are present in Jupyter notebook form, they can also be accessed with a link to a Google Colab notebook, which is recommended, because you can directly test out the code and utilize Google Colab's free GPU service.
